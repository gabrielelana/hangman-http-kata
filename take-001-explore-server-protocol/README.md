# Focus-On
First time I do this kata and I know nothing of the server protocol, how can I explore it? Some time ago I came across [htty](https://github.com/htty/htty), I always wanted to master it but never got/took the time, but this is exactly why we do katas right? So let's do it

# Step-01
Let's see if this thing works
```
$ htty balanced-hangman.herokuapp.com
*** Welcome to  htty , the HTTP TTY. Heck To The Yeah!
http://balanced-hangman.herokuapp.com/> get
 200  OK -- 5 headers -- 61-character body
http://balanced-hangman.herokuapp.com/> body
{
 "index": "/", 
 "me": "/me", 
 "prisoners": "/prisoners"
}
```
